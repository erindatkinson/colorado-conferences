# Colorado Conferences

This repo is a collection of Colorado conferences that I know about with some information about each of them inclusion on this list doesn't represent an endorsement unless explicitly endorsed in the agenda for each conference, nor does it guarantee that the venues submitted here will continue to have devent reviews for inclusivity in the future. All reviews are subjective and limited to the network I have. This also doesn't claim to be the entire list of conferences held in Colorado, but at least a decent starting point.
